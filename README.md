# Bandit Walkthrough ü•∑

> The kind of walkthrough I wish existed

## About

This is a walkthrough for Bandit - OverTheWire, a game used to master the Linux commands. 

Usual walkthroughs blurt out the solution, such as the password for the next level and the commands that were used to reach the file containing it. But most of the times, all you need is just a nudge that would help you reach the solution on your own. (I usually felt guilty checking walkthroughs whenever I got so badly stuck. No worries! I gotchu! ü§ó)

## Features 
* Comes with hints that encourage the user to read the man page, and googling (Wherever I felt it was needed).
* Does not give passwords of the levels.
* Does not give the user the complete answer (not applicable for first few levels), hence the user is forced to learn commands, hence, the purpose of Bandit is served.
